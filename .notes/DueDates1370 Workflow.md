# ðŸ“˜ EZLogger Workflow: DueDates1370View Launch and Functionality

This document explains the workflow for launching and interacting with the `DueDates1370View` in the EZLogger VSTO Word Add-in. It includes handler responsibilities, view setup, document property integration, and visual diagrams using Mermaid.

---

## âœ… Purpose of DueDates1370View

The `DueDates1370View` is a WPF UserControl embedded inside a WinForms host (`DueDates1370Host.vb`). It is used to:

- Display the **Commitment date** from the Word document's custom properties
- Allow the analyst to calculate and log due dates relevant to California Penal Code Â§1370 reports
- Write back calculated values (e.g., Days Since Due) to Word document properties

---

## ðŸ§± Components Involved

| Component | Responsibility |
|----------|----------------|
| `DueDates1370Host.vb` | Hosts the WPF view in a Windows Form with `ElementHost` |
| `DueDates1370View.xaml` | Displays commitment date label and due date selection UI |
| `ReportTypeHandler.vb` | Contains `LaunchDueDates1370View` and performs layout, initialization, and logic wiring |
| Word Document | Stores data like `Commitment` and `Days Since Due` in custom document properties |

---

## ðŸ§  Handler Responsibilities (`LaunchDueDates1370View`)

- Create host form: `Dim host As New DueDates1370Host()`
- Create and inject WPF view: `host.ElementHost1.Child = view`
- Read `Commitment` date from Word document and populate `CommitmentDateLbl`
- Set layout size and positioning of the form and `ElementHost`
- Wire up logic (e.g., via `DueDates1370Handler.PopulateDueDates(view)`)
- Show the form with `host.Show()`

## ðŸŽ¯ Sample Custom Document Properties Used

| Property Name      | Type   | Purpose                              |
|--------------------|--------|--------------------------------------|
| `Commitment`       | String | Read to display initial date         |
| `Days Since Due`   | Int    | Written to track time delta          |
| `Early90Day`       | Bool/Int | Determines whether to show a label  |

---

## ðŸ§° View Responsibilities (`DueDates1370View.xaml`)

- `CommitmentDateLbl`: A label to show the commitment date
- `PickDueDate`: A date picker to let the user choose the due date
- `LabelDaysSinceDueDate`: A label that shows the calculated day difference
- `BtnAcceptPPR`: A button to trigger logic (wired via handler or code-behind)
- `Early90DayLbl`: Conditionally shown based on `Early90Day` flag

## ðŸ“Š Workflow Diagram: Full Report Type Confirmation

```mermaid
graph TD
    id1[User clicks Confirm Report Type] --> id2{Is report type 1370?}
    id2 -- Yes --> id3[Call LaunchDueDates1370View]
    id3 --> id4[Create DueDates1370Host]
    id4 --> id5[Inject DueDates1370View into ElementHost]
    id5 --> id6[Read 'Commitment' from Word document]
    id6 --> id7[Set CommitmentDateLbl in the view]
    id7 --> id8[Position host using FormPositionHelper]
    id8 --> id9[Call PopulateDueDates using view]
    id9 --> id10[Show or hide Early90DayLbl based on doc flag]
    id10 --> id11[Show the host form]

    id2 -- No --> id12[Call LaunchDueDatesPprView or fallback view]
```

## ðŸ“Š Workflow Diagram: Form Load with Commitment Date

```mermaid
graph TD
    a1[LaunchDueDates1370View is called] --> a2[Create DueDates1370Host]
    a2 --> a3[Create DueDates1370View]
    a3 --> a4[Set view as child of ElementHost]
    a4 --> a5[Read 'Commitment' property from Word doc]
    a5 --> a6[Parse or fallback to raw string]
    a6 --> a7[Set CommitmentDateLbl in the view]
    a7 --> a8[Show host form to user]
```

---

## ðŸ§ª Logic Behind PopulateDueDates (Example)

In `DueDates1370Handler`, the method `PopulateDueDates(view)` may:

- Check if a `PickDueDate.SelectedDate` is set
- Compare it with `Today` to calculate delta
- Write the result to the Word docâ€™s custom property: `Days Since Due`
- Update the viewâ€™s label (`LabelDaysSinceDueDate.Content`)

---

## ðŸ”š Summary

The `DueDates1370View` launch process is carefully managed by `ReportTypeHandler.vb`, following a consistent VSTO+WPF+WinForms hybrid pattern. By using Word document properties and centralized handlers, the logic remains modular, testable, and easy to replicate for views like `DueDatePprView`.

In the next guide, weâ€™ll build the `DueDatePprView` using this same structure.
