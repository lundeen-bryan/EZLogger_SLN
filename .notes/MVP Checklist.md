### 4. Logging to SQLite

- [ ] Insert processed report entries into `Log` table
- [ ] Include: patient number, evaluator, report type, timestamp, PDF filename
- [ ] Display logged records in `LogThisView`

### 5. Configuration Integration

- [X] Load global config (`global_config.json`) for report types and other settings

- [ ] Use config to populate ComboBoxes (e.g., report types, doctor list)

### 6. Core UI & Workflow

- [ ] Wire all buttons to handlers (even if using placeholder logic)
- [X] Confirm `CustomMsgBox` works with OK / Yes / No options
- [ ] Confirm everything works inside the Word task pane (WinForms ElementHost)

- Focus is on delivering a working workflow, not polishing UI or writing all helper tests yet.
- PDF export and due date calculator are considered **core features**, not optional.
- Logs must be written directly to SQLite, not to JSON files.
